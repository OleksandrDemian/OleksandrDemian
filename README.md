### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Oleksandr.

I'm a software developer born in Ukraine, currently working in Italy (Milano).

I've started my programming career by creating video games with Unity3D (I've created a couple of really bad games with no success). When I understood that it's difficult to live with cash I've made with my games (like 30 cents) I started working as a web developer. I've never had a well defined role, my mansions range from programming (both front-end and back-end) to setting up CI/CD and managing servers (although I'm not very passionate about the last one).

#### :poop: Skills
At the moment of writing (year 2020), mine main skills are the following:

##### :keyboard: Programming languages
- Javascript (my favourite :100:)
- Java (have to use for work :worried:)
- C# (with Unity3D api, I've never used .Net framework for webdev :sweat_smile:)

##### :fire: Front-end
- Svelte 3 (my favourite, :fire::fire::fire:)
- React
- Vanilla javascript
- CSS (good knowledge, but I'm really bad at designing UI :disappointed:)

##### :building_construction: Back-end

- Java EE

##### :books: Database

:heavy_exclamation_mark: This list is long, but by the end of the day my main skill is Javascript.
