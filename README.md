### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Oleksandr.

I'm a software developer born in Ukraine, currently working in Italy (Milan).

I've started my programming career by creating video games with Unity3D (I've created a couple of really bad games with no success). When I understood that it's difficult to live with cash I've made with my games (like 30 cents) I started working as a web developer. I've never had a well defined role, my mansions range from programming (both front-end and back-end) to setting up CI/CD and managing servers.
