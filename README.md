### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Oleksandr.

A software developer based in Milan, Italy. Even though my main role is frontend development using **React**, **Node**, **Typescript**, and **Next**, I frequently see my mansions shifting to fill whatever has to be done to achieve the goal (data analysis, backend development, or CI/CD).

In my free time I'm most likely working on a side project involving AI or game dev.
