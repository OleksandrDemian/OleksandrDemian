### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Oleksandr.

I'm a software developer born in Ukraine, currently working in Italy (Milano).

I've started my programming career by creating video games with Unity3D (I've created a couple of really bad games with no success). When I understood that it's difficult to live with cash I've made with my games (like 30 cents) I started working as a web developer. I've never had a well defined role, my mansions range from programming (both front-end and back-end) to setting up CI/CD and managing servers (although I'm not very passionate about the last one).

#### Skills :poop:
At the moment of writing (year 2020), mine main skills are the following:

##### Programming languages :keyboard:
- Javascript (my favourite :100:)
- Java (have to use for work :worried:)
- C# (with Unity3D api, I've never used .Net framework for webdev :sweat_smile:)

##### Front-end :fire:
- Svelte 3 (my favourite)
- React
- Vanilla javascript
- CSS (good knowledge, but I'm really bad at designing UI :disappointed:)

##### Back-end :building_construction:
- Spring
- Java EE

##### Database :books:
- Firebase

##### Cloud platforms :cloud:
- Google cloud platform

##### Application server :floppy_disk:

##### CI/CD :factory:

##### Tests

:heavy_exclamation_mark: This list is long, but by the end of the day my main skill is Javascript.
